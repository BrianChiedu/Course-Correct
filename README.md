# Course Correct

## Description
Founded a tutoring startup while I lived in Dublin called Course Correct. The mission was to tutor kids who were behind in school due to the impact of COVID-19. Along with three other college students I contracted we taught English, Math, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Irish. Today Course Correct is dissolved 
but over our existence we taught over 10 kids and generated over 10,000 euros with me as the CEO. This repository contains the website I built using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript to promote Course Correct and help us gain more 
customers. I implemented google analytics to monitor and track visitors. I also practiced semantic HTML as well as responsive web design. Lastly, I integrated off the shelf booking management software called <a href="https://www.classcardapp.com/">Classcard</a>
into my site.
